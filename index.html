    <p class= "p2">Kpop has always been a very controversal topic amoung society. People are always comparing kpop to western artists and accusations are made that koreans copy's western artists and vice versa. But that is never the case. Everyone can take inspiration from one another and it is ok to express a certain culture through music. Music is art and all art is subjective. Every song is unique in its own way but takes a hint of inspiration from western artists when it comes to there music videos.</p><br><br><br><br>
